# Password Strength Checker (JavaScript)

A simple password strength checker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It gives users real-time feedback on the strength of their password while typing.

## Features
- Live password strength detection (updates as you type)
- Strength levels: Weak, Medium, and Strong
- Checks for:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
  - Minimum length
- Dynamic UI feedback (message + input border color + button border color)
- Clean, responsive design

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for logic

## How it works
1. User starts typing a password.
2. The script evaluates the input against multiple rules.
3. Based on the score, a message appears showing whether the password is Weak, Medium, or Strong.
4. The border color of the input and button also changes to give a quick visual indicator.

## Usage
